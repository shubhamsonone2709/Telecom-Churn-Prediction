# Telecom-Churn-Prediction
Introduction
Customer churn prediction is an important task in customer relationship management. It helps businesses identify customers who are likely to leave and take proactive steps to retain them. In this project, we'll work with a dataset containing customer information and use machine learning to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
xgboost
imblearn
seaborn
You can install these libraries using the following command:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost imbalanced-learn seaborn

Model Training and Evaluation
Different classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Random Forest) are trained on the training data.
Model performance is evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports on the testing data.

Results
The project outputs the results of model training and evaluation for each algorithm. You'll see confusion matrices and classification reports that provide insights into how well the models are performing
